# AEGIS — Development Roadmap

> **Created:** 2026-06-26
> **Status:** Active
> **Baseline:** Integrated from both source documents, improved with optimized ordering

---

## Overview

The roadmap is organized into **6 milestones** that build progressively. Each milestone produces a working, demonstrable increment. The ordering prioritizes establishing the integration contract (shared schemas) first, then building both sides (AI core + platform) in parallel.

### Timeline Summary

```
Milestone 1: Foundation & Contracts        ──── Week 1-2
Milestone 2: RAG Pipeline & Basic Backend  ──── Week 3-5
Milestone 3: Neo4j & GraphRAG             ──── Week 5-7
Milestone 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration     ──── Week 7-10
Milestone 5: Adversarial Loop & Confidence ──── Week 10-13
Milestone 6: Integration, Polish & Demo    ──── Week 13-16
```

|------------|-------|-------------|
| Vertex AI embedding client | Shlok | `retrieval/embeddings.py` — batch + query embedding via text-embedding-005 |
| Document chunking | Shlok | `retrieval/chunking.py` — 500-token chunks with overlap |
| ChromaDB vector store | Shlok | `retrieval/vector_store.py` — collection management, add/query |
| Document ingestion pipeline | Shlok | `retrieval/ingestion.py` — process PDFs/text → chunks → embed → store |
| Demo corpus | Shlok | 20-50 documents (policy PDFs, news articles, SEC filings) |
| Recon Agent (v1) | Shlok | Working agent with DuckDuckGo search + ChromaDB RAG |
| Query API endpoint | Aditya | `POST /api/query` — accepts query, calls orchestrator, returns result |

### Testing Criteria
- [ ] Ingestion pipeline processes 10+ documents without errors
- [ ] ChromaDB returns relevant chunks for test queries
- [ ] Recon Agent produces structured `AgentResponse` with citations
- [ ] `POST /api/query` triggers agent and returns result
- [ ] WebSocket pushes `agent_started` and `briefing_ready` events
- [ ] Frontend displays query results with sources
- [ ] Auth protects query endpoints (401 without token)

### Definition of Done
User can log in, submit a query, see the Recon Agent execute in real-time via WebSocket, and view a structured response with citations.

## Milestone 3: Neo4j & GraphRAG

> **Objective:** Add the knowledge graph layer (Neo4j) and implement hybrid GraphRAG retrieval combining vector search with graph traversal.

### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Owner | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Neo4j client | Shlok | `graph_rag/neo4j_client.py` — connection, query execution, transaction management |
| Graph schema | Shlok | `graph_rag/schema.py` — Node/Edge definitions, constraints, indexes |
| Entity extraction | Shlok | `graph_rag/entity_extraction.py` — spaCy NER + optional Gemini extraction |

| Seed data | Shlok | Pre-built graph with ~500 nodes covering demo scenarios |
| Hybrid retrieval | Shlok | `retrieval/` updated to merge vector chunks + graph context |
| GraphRAG in Recon Agent | Shlok | Recon Agent uses both ChromaDB and Neo4j for retrieval |
| Neo4j Docker config | Aditya | Docker Compose updated with Neo4j Community service |
| Graph API endpoints (optional) | Aditya | `GET /api/graph/query` for direct graph queries (P2) |
| Dashboard updates | Aditya | Display graph-sourced evidence separately in UI |

### Dependencies

- Neo4j Community running in Docker

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Entity extraction quality | Start with spaCy; supplement with Gemini for complex docs |
| Neo4j query performance | Add indexes on `name` properties; limit traversal depth to 2 hops |
| Graph data sparsity | Pre-load seed data for demo scenarios |

### Testing Criteria
- [ ] Neo4j container starts and accepts Cypher queries
- [ ] Entity extraction produces nodes/edges from test documents
- [ ] Cypher queries return relevant subgraphs for test entities
- [ ] Hybrid retrieval returns both vector chunks and graph context
- [ ] Recon Agent response quality improves with GraphRAG vs RAG-only

### Definition of Done
Recon Agent uses hybrid retrieval (ChromaDB + Neo4j) and produces demonstrably richer responses with entity relationship context.

## Milestone 4: Multi-Agent Orchestration

> **Objective:** Implement all domain agents (Financial, Geopolitical) and the LangGraph orchestrator that dispatches them in parallel.

### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Owner | Description |

### Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Parallel LLM rate limits | Sequential fallback if rate limited; exponential backoff |
| Agent response time variance | Set per-agent timeout (30s); use fastest model (Flash) |
| LangGraph complexity | Start with simple linear graph; add parallel edges incrementally |

### Testing Criteria
- [ ] Financial Agent returns valid market data with citations
- [ ] Geopolitical Agent returns policy analysis with citations
- [ ] LangGraph orchestrator dispatches all 3 agents in parallel
- [ ] Total response time < 45 seconds for 3 agents
- [ ] Synthesis Agent produces coherent narrative from 3 agent outputs

|------|-----------|
| DA adds significant latency | Max 2 rounds; Gemini Pro is faster than GPT-4 |
| DA challenges everything trivially | Strict validity criteria (Tier 1-2 sources, direct contradiction) |
| Confidence scores feel arbitrary | Calibrate α/β on test queries; document formula clearly |

### Testing Criteria
- [ ] Devil's Advocate identifies valid contradictions in test scenarios
- [ ] Targeted re-run produces revised claims
- [ ] DA loop terminates within 2 rounds
- [ ] Confidence scores reflect evidence quality (more sources = higher)
- [ ] Challenge events appear in WebSocket stream
